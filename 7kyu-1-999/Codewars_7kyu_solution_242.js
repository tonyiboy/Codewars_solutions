// Your team is writing a fancy new text editor and you've been tasked with implementing the line numbering.

// Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number.

// The numbering starts at 1. The format is n: string. Notice the colon and space in between.

// Examples: (Input --> Output)

// [] --> []
// ["a", "b", "c"] --> ["1: a", "2: b", "3: c"]

var number=function(array){
    
    let arr = []
    array.forEach((a,b) => arr.push((b + 1) + ": " + a))
    
    return arr
    }
