// ask
// Given a Divisor and a Bound , Find the largest integer N , Such That ,

// Conditions :
// N is divisible by divisor

// N is less than or equal to bound

// N is greater than 0.

// Notes
// The parameters (divisor, bound) passed to the function are only positive values .
// It's guaranteed that a divisor is Found .
// Input >> Output Examples
// divisor = 2, bound = 7 ==> return (6)
// Explanation:
// (6) is divisible by (2) , (6) is less than or equal to bound (7) , and (6) is > 0 .

// divisor = 10, bound = 50 ==> return (50)
// Explanation:
// (50) is divisible by (10) , (50) is less than or equal to bound (50) , and (50) is > 0 .*

// divisor = 37, bound = 200 ==> return (185)
// Explanation:
// (185) is divisible by (37) , (185) is less than or equal to bound (200) , and (185) is > 0 .
